## Description

<p>The planning and prototyping of accessibility features for the <em>Ground Works</em> scholarly journal to develop a series of recommendations for how publishing digital art historical journals can sensitively work with the artistic production of disabled artists.</p>
<p><em>Ground Works</em>, a platform for interdisciplinary research, is creating an online archive called Reco(r)ding CripTech that documents the collaborative processes of six disabled artists focused on disability innovation and aesthetic access. The archive will include the artifacts of the artistsâ€™ processes. We will explore best practices for the preparation, accessibility, representation, deposit, and citation of these items in an online archive, through the following key activities 1) creating a prototype archive. 2) a workshop with humanities scholars to test the usability, accessibility, and legibility of the archive.  3) creation of a set of best practice guidelines for such an archive. The outcomes will be a prototype archive of practice products, available to humanities scholars and digital scholarly publishers for use and feedback, and a draft outline of best practices for the online archiving of these rich-media non-scholarly artifacts.</p>
