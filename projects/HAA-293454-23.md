## Description

<p>The development of tools to automatically align musical performances and scores that will allow users to analyze performances and scores simultaneously and at scale. </p>
<p>Vast troves of both sound recordings and musical scores have become widely available in the digital era, but drawing connections between these two mediums to develop insights about performance style and artistic expression has remained difficult and time-consuming. This project develops a prototype of an open-source software tool to facilitate studying recorded music performances. Our tool will assist music scholars, archivists, and enthusiasts in complex musical analysis by both streamlining their workflows and expanding their capabilities, enhanced by advanced AI technologies and an easy-to-use graphical interface, without requiring programming experience. To optimize usability, our software design will be informed by real-world experts and prospective users. This tool will enable users to examine performances and scores in a single integrated process, scale up existing research, and open up transformative new approaches to musicology and music theory research.</p>
