## Description

<p>A series of meetings to develop a prototype for a federated digital resource on North American weather and climate data collected during the 18th- and 19th-centuries.</p>
<p>The proposed project is a collaborative effort between the Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Princeton University, the Center for Digital Editing at the University of Virginia, and the Center for Digital Scholarship at the American Philosophical Society. The project is seeking level one funding to support planning meetings, a workshop, drafting of technical specifications, and the development of a prototype for federated weather and climate records digital resource. Planning and experimentation work during this grant period will lay the groundwork for the future development of a federated weather and climate records platform. This platform will support both the editorial preparation (broadly conceived) and publication of weather and climate records. Planning and development work will ultimately result in the publication of the Federated Early North American Weather Records Digital Resource.</p>
