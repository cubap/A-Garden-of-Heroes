## Description

<p>Convening a group of religious studies scholars and technologists to research best practices and evaluate the appropriateness of recording and interpreting religious rituals in extended reality (XR) for teaching religion.</p>
<p>This project seeks to convene a meeting of religious studies scholars and experts in XR modalities to explore the creation of immersive videos analyzing and explaining religious rituals. The proposed two-day advisory meeting will evaluate the best practices for creating stereoscopic (360 degrees) videos combined with documentary style analysis and discussion into resources aimed at teaching about religion. The meeting will consist of presentations by scholars of various religious traditions and experts in educational immersive technologies, paired with brainstorming sessions considering appropriate representations of diverse religious traditions, suitable methods regarding the filming and dissemination of such videos, and concerns around maintaining connections between practices and the living communities that hold them sacred. Information generated by our collaboration will be made publicly available and serve as the backbone for a blueprint towards the creation phase of the project.</p>
