## Description

<p>The further development of The Bridge Readability Tools platform for analyzing and teaching ancient Greek and Latin texts.</p>
<p>The Bridge Readability Tools Project will develop three pedagogical and scholarly tools for The Bridge, an existing digital ecosystem that supports the encoding and reading of Ancient Greek and Latin at the secondary, collegiate, and professional levels. These independent tools, which will form a mutually-supporting suite of Bridge Readability Tools, will (1) produce practical analyses of textual difficulty (i.e., readability) for the hundreds of texts in the Bridge Corpus via Bridge/Stats; (2) facilitate data-informed language syllabus and curriculum construction via Bridge/Oracle, which will help instructors, students, and independent learners discover readable texts and plan data-supported curricula, fostering more efficient acquisition of historical languages; (2) democratize and accelerate the accurate encoding of Latin texts from classical antiquity to the modern period via the Bridge/Lemmatizer2 tool.</p>
