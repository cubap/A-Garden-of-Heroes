## Description

<p>A series of roundtables and the development of case studies on ethical and legal issues for US-based humanities researchers around data mining of large-scale textual collections held outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining - Cross-Border (“LLTDM-X”) is a Level 1 Advancement Grant project addressing law and policy issues faced by U.S. digital humanities (DH) practitioners whose text data mining (TDM) research and practice intersects with foreign-held or -licensed content, or involves international collaborations. Through a series of virtual roundtables and accompanying legal research and analysis, LLTDM-X will surface these issues and distill preliminary guidance for navigating them—making possible future instruction modules to facilitate critical DH research. These outcomes achieve NEH Advancement Grant funding priorities of pursuing evaluations “that investigate the practices and the impact of digital scholarship on research, pedagogy, scholarly communication, and public engagement.”</p>
