## Description

<p>The development of training data and workflows
for the computational analysis of Yiddish language and literature, as a case
study for other low-resource languages.</p>
<p>We are applying for a Level II grant to research computational methods to make possible the computational analysis of literature for low resource languages - languages for which little natural language processing training data or tools exist, but which have a large amount of text to analyze. Our main goal is to allow such software to be built with much less annotated corpora. The key activities are to research computational methods combined with a relatively small amount of new annotation to build a BookNLP pipeline for Yiddish, a particularly acute case of a low resource language.  There is a range of languages for which these tools could then be applied, resulting in pipelines for those languages (e.g. Early Modern English). The intended audience therefore consists of humanities researchers in Yiddish and other low resource languages. The outputs will be the Yiddish BookNLP pipeline, the new annotation, and the fully-documented newly developed training procedures.</p>
