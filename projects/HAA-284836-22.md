## Description

<p>The further development of user interfaces for collective translation of the collections in the Digital Archive for American Indian Languages Preservation and Perseverance (DAILP), a digital archive of Cherokee-language manuscripts and lexical resources.</p>
<p>Cherokee language documents are a ready source of valuable insight into the cultural, linguistic, and historical legacy of the Cherokee people. With an online environment to facilitate translation, Cherokee language experts and scholars could translate these documents collectively with Cherokee language learners of all ages who are found in online classes, immersion schools, university classrooms, and communities. And their translation work could be supported with ready access to the lexical datasets found in dictionaries, wordlists, and grammars. The Digital Archive for American Indian Languages Preservation and Perseverance (DAILP) seeks to address these needs by creating a digital archive of Cherokee-language manuscripts and lexical resources to support the collective translation of American Indian language manuscripts, and to advance indigenous language learning, translation, and documentation.</p>
