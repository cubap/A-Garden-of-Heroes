## Description

<p>Enhancement of a website publishing comprehensive data on landmarks enabled by the New Deal. The project includes a data audit, incorporation of demographic and spatial data, and new tools for data sharing. </p>
<p>New Deal agencies extensively modernized the U.S. built environment and impacted U.S. residents from every demographic, yet, for decades, their vast spatial footprint remained undocumented. Living New Deal (LND) is the first comprehensive effort to crowdsource the location of New Deal public works, publishing their geospatial and related qualitative data through a searchable database in WordPress and a Mapbox interactive map, which serve over 1.25 million visitors annually. We seek Level II funding to enhance LND’s contributions to socio-spatial understanding of New Deal public works by: 1) auditing and upgrading our existing data, 2) incorporating U.S. Census spatial and population data to expand their scope, 3) piloting methods for locating additional demographic data regionally that can be scaled by LND nationally, and 4) developing data download functionality and a digital humanities section for our website to strengthen LND’s ability to support timely debates in the humanities.</p>
