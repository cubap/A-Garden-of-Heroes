## Description

<p>The development of new features for Urban Archive’s digital infrastructure, which serves as a collections management system and location-based digital platform for cultural organizations. </p>
<p>Urban Archive is requesting a Level II Digital Humanities Advancement Grant to support the enhancement of our award-winning digital infrastructure, which provides a diverse network of cultural organizations across New York State (and beyond) with a location-based digital platform and collections-management system that dramatically expands the reach of their digitized collections of historical materials. Our specific project is to implement Phase 4 of the Collections Management and Engagement Program (CMEP), which is the hub of all partner activity on Urban Archive, consolidating all of our partners’ collection files, metadata, and tools into a unified dashboard.</p>
