## Description

<p>A prototype toolkit and user documentation to allow lower-resourced cultural heritage organizations to digitize collections at low cost.</p>
<p>This project aims to develop an integrated digitization toolkit to allow under-resourced institutions, collectives, and communities to digitize their archival collections at low cost. Building on a decade of community-based digitization work in the Global South, we seek Level I funding to design and release a prototype of a new generation of tools built on sustainable, up-to-date technologies. We will create an alpha prototype version, test and evaluate the toolkit at the Santa Barbara Mission Archive-Library (CA), and hold listening sessions to identify a series of potential partners for the project's next stages. The main outputs for this project will be (1) the alpha-level working prototype of the hardware; (2) the alpha-level software to power it; (3) detailed documentation for dissemination and reuse; and (4) a network of potential traditional and non-traditional archival partners working towards egalitarian access to digitization technologies.</p>
