## Description

<p>The design and development of a prototype open-source tool for 360° mapping of historical photographs. </p>
<p>Our team proposes research and development on an augmented reality mapping application for the Fortepan.us digital photo archival platform. The application will display superimposed geolocated historical photos onto a modern-day 360° streetscape (like an open source “Google Historical Street View”). Our intent is to match historical photos of American campuses and main streets to the very place and perspective from which the photographer captured the original photograph, and display the photos, decade by decade (e.g., 1900, 1910, 1920), in a customized historical “Mainstreet 360°” street view. We also aim to provide a means for interpreting the augmented reality historical scenes through text fields for each decade and small pop up info boxes atop photographs. We will present 2 workshops (1 virtual), create a “how-to” video series, and promote the app at conferences. Our final aim: demystify 360° imaging and empower cultural heritage institutions to use this easy, powerful visual tool.</p>
