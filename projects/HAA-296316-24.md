## Description

<p>The integration of six ancient languages into an open-source Braille digital translation platform to enable the creation of digital editions and primary sources for blind and low-vision humanities students and researchers.  <br /></p>
<p>Inaccessible materials have prevented blind students and scholars from participating equally in the study of ancient languages, literature, and history. The solution proposed in this project will make hundreds of thousands of primary texts available to braille readers and progress these students and scholars toward more equal footing with their sighted colleagues. Nearly every blind person with a computer or mobile device will have the same immediate access to digitized texts that sighted scholars already enjoy.</p>
