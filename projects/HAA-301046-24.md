## Description

<p>Continuing work on the digital infrastructure
for the Post45 Data Collective, a
peer-reviewed, open-access repository for literary and cultural data after 1945.  This stage will support the development of a comprehensive data style guide and set of protocols
for interoperability with complementary datasets.</p>
<p>We seek a Level II Digital Humanities Advancement Grant to support the continued growth of the Post45 Data Collective, a peer-reviewed, open-access repository for literary and cultural data from 1945 to the present. With such a grant we would develop a comprehensive data style guide and a set of protocols that will further improve the interoperability of data in our collective, in the field, and in the humanities. We particularly seek to make our book- and author-related data more interoperable, which will require the development of computational methods for fetching relevant book and author identifiers and merging them together across datasets. We plan to publish these resources open-access on our website, and we also plan to share them directly with emerging data collectives that use our collective as a model, such as Nineteenth Century Data Collective and the Early Twentieth-Century Data Collective, and to researchers in the field.</p>
