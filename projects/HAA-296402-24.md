## Description

<p>A digital mapping project focused on determining the feasibility of using digitized genealogical records and archival state maps to identify and geolocate enslaved African Americans. </p>
<p>This proposal seeks Level I funding in the amount of $75,000 to generate a relational database and map that will expand our understanding of Black life and geography during slavery in the United States. Where David Eltis’s Slave Voyages brought us to the shores and ports of the Americas, our proposed project, Data Mining and Mapping Antebellum Georgia (DMMAG) takes us inland, turning from the Trans-Atlantic to the Intra-American enslavement and forced migrations of Africans and African Americans. The goal of this proposal is to generate a scalable prototype for DMMAG’s proposed database and map, which will address the following question: to what extent can researchers use digitized genealogical archives and archival state maps to both identify and geolocate individual enslaved African Americans and their families before emancipation?</p>
