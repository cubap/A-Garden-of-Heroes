# A Garden of Heroes

A Garden of Heroes is a public platform dedicated to recording digital humanities projects that were canceled due to the DOGE interference with the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2025. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for hosting and contributing to these important narratives.

## Project Structure

- **src/index.html**: The main HTML entry point for the website, linking to CSS and JavaScript files.
- **src/css/styles.css**: Contains styles for the website, defining layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.
- **src/js/main.js**: JavaScript code for interactivity, handling form submissions and dynamic content updates.
- **src/projects/example-project.md**: An example Markdown document for recording a digital humanities project, including sections for title, description, and relevant links.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
