## Description

<p>Further development of a database of Catherine the Great’s correspondence, as well as tools for scholarly analysis and editing. </p>
<p>We are applying for a Level II DHAG to build the infrastructure needed to scale up an existing pilot database, CatCor: The Digital Correspondence of Catherine the Great, to the production stage by: 1) establishing a robust workflow on GitHub; 2) creating a coding environment based on the Linked Editing Academic Framework (LEAF-VRE); 3) enhancing LEAF software with LOD named entity lookups, integrated AI-generation and correction of translations, and detailed documentation of LEAF’s use; 4) creating a knowledge graph of Catherine’s world from the letters and linked data; and 5) building an analysis platform using open-source tools. We address DHAG’s second priority area by enhancing and designing new digital infrastructure with outputs including open-source code, platforms, and documentation. While the software and documentation are aimed at subject and DH specialists, the knowledge graph and analysis platform will provide the public with an unparalleled knowledge base about Catherine.</p>
