## Description


<p>The Community Heritage Empowerment Toolkit (CHET) project will create a prototype serves standards-based toolkit, consisting of video, written, and aural guides, instructing grassroots heritage preservation organizations how to document a structure’s Life History.  Often the community preservationists who have the desire and time to do this recordation possess limited technical expertise or lack sufficient funding to purchase specialized equipment.  There is one ubiquitous and empowering device that has the capability to change this: the smartphone.  CHET will provide a comprehensive yet accessible smartphone-enabled digital recordation toolkit enabling the completion of small and medium-scale digital documentation projects.  This will empower the entire community to actively participate in preservation and expand information capture locally.</p>
