## Description

<p>The development of a platform to map and visualize racial covenants in early 20th Century Milwaukee.</p>
<p>The Mapping Racism and Resistance project examines the critical role of racial covenants, as they worked together with other discriminatory housing practices, in restricting Black access to housing in Milwaukee County. We are seeking NEH DHAG funding to support 1) the development of a repository for data and digital assets generated in phase one of the project; 2) the creation of maps and web content visualizing racial covenants and Black resistance to restrictive covenants and other forms of housing discrimination in the early part of the 20th Century; and 3) the redesign and redevelopment of our website to support expanded public engagement with our digital resources on racial covenants and challenges to them in Milwaukee County.</p>
