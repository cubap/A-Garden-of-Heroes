## Description

<p>The expansion of the North American Climate History project with the addition of new partner organizations and continued development of the data model and prototype site for a federated platform for historical weather and climate records</p>
<p>The North American Climate History project is a collaborative effort between the Papers of Thomas Jefferson at Princeton University, the Center for Digital Editing at the University of Virginia, and the Center for Digital Scholarship at the American Philosophical Society. The primary goal of the project is the development of a federated weather and climate records platform. This platform will support both the editorial preparation (broadly conceived) and publication of weather and climate records. Planning and development work will ultimately result in the publication of the federated North American Climate History digital resource. This digital resource will provide access to weather and climate records and will serve as a platform for projects, archives, and special collections to add materials to the federated resource.</p>
