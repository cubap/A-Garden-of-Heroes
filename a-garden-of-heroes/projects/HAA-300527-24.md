## Description

<p>Continued development and revitalization of the London Stage Database, an online resource that brings together multiple sources documenting the history of British theater.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019 with Level II DHAG funding, the London Stage Database (londonstagedatabase.uoregon.edu) has been hailed as “field-changing” for eighteenth-century theater studies. This open-access database of nightly playhouse offerings 1660-1800 has also resonated beyond academe, logging upwards of 130,000 page views from more than 13,500 unique visitors and garnering high-profile media attention. Today, this vitally important piece of digital humanities infrastructure is ripe for upgrades that will leverage newly digitized materials and cutting-edge technologies to meet the emerging needs of a growing audience. We propose to extend the project’s reach, utility, and longevity by migrating to a more sustainable web hosting architecture; improving data discovery and interoperability through linked open data; enhancing the user experience with new content and features; deepening collaborative relationships with user communities; and building DH research capacity at the host institution.</p>
