## Description

<p>The development and release of new features for the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer platform used by librarians and archivists to annotate and share oral history collections online.</p>
<p>This project, a collaboration between Dartmouth College and the University of Kentucky, undertakes a major enhancement of the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS), the pre-eminent digital platform for managing and indexing oral history archives.  Drawing on the prior work of the Dartmouth Digital History Initiative (DDHI), the project team will add advanced data annotation and Named Entity Recognition functionality to the OHMS application.  The project team will also draw on the DDHIâ€™s prior experience with data visualization to add mapping and timeline features to the OHMS viewer.  The project will benefit archivists and curators who implement OHMS on digital oral history collections.  It will also benefit the end users of oral history archives, who will have new digital tools for exploring and learning from these collections.  All deliverables for this project will be available on a free and open-source basis.</p>
