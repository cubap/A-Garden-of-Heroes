## Description

<p>Development and testing of open-source software designed for scholars and students to analyze and annotate dramatic texts.  <br /></p>
<p>Digital Dramaturgy is a web-based tool that converts, publishes, and preserves dramaturgical products, particularly script annotations, glossaries, and interpretive essays, via free, online digital exhibits. It is designed to be used in both high school/college classrooms and productions. The tool has been successfully incorporated into two dramaturgy courses and one theatrical production at the University of Idaho, leading the project team to wonder if it might be useful beyond our local contexts. With this award, our team of dramaturgs, developers, Shakespeare scholars, and pedagogy experts will use feedback from educators and theatre professionals to further develop the tool, its documentation, and related educational material over the course of a year, resulting in two major outputs: 1) the release of a minimum viable product version of the platform; and 2) a decision as to whether to commit to the ongoing work necessary to promote and maintain such a project on a national scale.</p>
