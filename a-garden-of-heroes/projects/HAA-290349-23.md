## Description

<p>The
continuing development of the open educational resource, Literature in Context,
an open-access, curated, and classroom-sourced digital anthology of British and
American literature in English in partnership with scholars and students from Marymount
University.</p>
<p>We are applying for a Level III Grant to build out Literature in Context, a TEI-encoded digital anthology of literature in the English language from 1400 to 1925, designed for use by students, teachers, and the general public. Our project innovates by taking full advantage of the affordances of digitization to create an Open Educational Resource that incorporates interactivity, digitized page images of original editions, and other contextual materials, making it a true replacement for the costly print anthologies used in American and British literature survey courses across the globe.</p>
