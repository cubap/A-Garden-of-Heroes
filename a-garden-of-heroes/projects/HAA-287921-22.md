## Description

<p>The migration of an existing database and the development of an updated public interface and search engine for the Stolen Relations project, along with outreach activities with local New England tribal communities.</p>
<p>Stolen Relations: Recovering Stories of Indigenous Enslavement in the Americas (www.indigenousslavery.org) is a community-centered, collaborative project that seeks to broaden our understanding of Indigenous experiences of settler colonialism and its legacies through the lens of slavery and servitude. We are applying for a Level III NEH DHAG in order to design and program a front end public interface, initiate new partnerships (especially with the Tomaquag Museum), and build and expand the technical aspects of the database (including linked open data and migrating to Mukurtu). We are gathering and documenting as many instances as possible of Indigenous enslavement in the Americas between 1492 and 1900 (and beyond, where relevant), focused primarily on New England for now, in close partnership with thirteen regional tribes, nations, and communities. Our project seeks to recover the stories of individuals and make these stories and documents available for use by a broad range of people.</p>
