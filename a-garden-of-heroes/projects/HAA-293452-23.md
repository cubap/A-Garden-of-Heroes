## Description

<p>The further development and expansion of an existing platform to enable large-scale Artificial Intelligence-assisted surveys of archaeological sites. </p>
<p>Archaeology contributes unique insights into the human story across many scales, but the fieldâ€™s traditional methods are not well-suited for working beyond the scale of small regions. We employ digital methods to document archaeological landscapes across regions, in our NEH ODH-sponsored webapp GeoPACHA: Geospatial Platform for Andean Culture, History, and Archaeology. In this three year project, we will revise the GeoPACHA codebase to enable AI-assisted archaeological imagery survey, and refine our deep learning models for archaeological feature detection, which leverage the large set of human-tagged features previously registered on GeoPACHA. We will then conduct an autonomous survey of satellite imagery across the central Andes. Our network of regional experts and their diverse student surveyors will then edit and enrich these AI-generated datasets via GeoPACHA 2.0, in a human-machine teaming effort that will result in the largest imagery survey in the western hemisphere.</p>
