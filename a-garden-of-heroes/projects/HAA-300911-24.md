## Description

<p>Further development of a set of remote sensing methods for archaeological sites by conducting surveys at multiple locations in the United States and collecting data on Indigenous land use features. </p>
<p>Although archaeological scholarship demonstrates the significance of relict agricultural landscape features to offer insights into many aspects of ancient societies, evidence of past land use practices can be difficult to recognize and is easily destroyed by modern development. The proposed project has developed a suite of digital remote sensing methods to facilitate rapid, non-destructive, non-invasive discovery, documentation, and analysis of ancient land use features. Building on existing collaborations with Indigenous communities and archaeological specialists, the proposed project will employ drone-based lidar, thermography, and infrared imaging, alongside terrestrial geophysics, to document past agricultural landscapes. With surveys in New Mexico, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and New England, results will document extensive remains of agricultural features and related sites, offering new perspectives on Indigenous land use while supporting preservation and protection efforts.</p>
