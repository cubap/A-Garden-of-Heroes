## Description

<p>Development and implementation of solar-powered archival storage to reduce the environmental impact of digital preservation, as well as documentation to support adoption of this model.</p>
<p>The Center for Experimental Humanities (EH) at Bard College proposes a new initiative that creatively re-envisions archives and the reliance of small institutions on external data storage providers while also significantly cutting overall contribution to institutional carbon footprint. As a proof-of-concept Level I project, we will redesign and migrate our EH digital archive, currently hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), to a “solar server” that we will design, prototype and self-host. Our designs will then be made available via an open-source toolkit and white paper so that other humanities centers and low-resourced programs can reimagine their archive to be self-sustaining and environmentally responsible.</p>
