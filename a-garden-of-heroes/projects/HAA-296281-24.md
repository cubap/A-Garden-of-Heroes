## Description

<p>The creation of an open-source platform for network analysis of art and artists.</p>
<p>We seek Level II funding to develop the Artistic Network Toolbox (ANT), an open-source, user-friendly platform for scholars and students to curate, visualize, and share the relationships between art, its creators, and its contexts. While prior digital humanities projects have shown the value of network analysis to explore artistic production, doing so required expensive, one-off software development customized for each project. Instead, the goal of ANT is to democratize access to network analysis in art historical scholarship. To do so, ANT will leverage 100% open-source technologies, providing one-click generation of a fully-functional website with no programming expertise, and making database curation as simple as editing a spreadsheet. ANT will model diverse artistic connections in a dynamic network analysis that can be customized and visualized for nuanced explorations of artistic exchange.</p>
