## Description

<p>The enhancement of the Transcription for Paleographical and Editorial Notation (TPEN) platform for transcribing texts from handwritten documents by updating the technical backend, adding new features to allow for greater use with non-Western humanities collections, and conducting outreach activities to scholarly audiences. </p>
<p>This project consists of a revitalization of the Transcription for Paleographical and Editorial Notation (TPEN; t-pen.org) program, a decade-old free online tool that scholars around the world use to transcribe texts from handwritten documents. The project involves updating the program to meet current web standards; developing code and standards that will contribute to the Open Source community; and designing new features for enhanced project management (including more tailored privacy and team-member role settings), an increasing array of interfaces to accommodate a wider range of textual artifact elements (e.g., right-to-left languages, charts and tables, layered texts, pictorial representations), and more and easier options for exporting transcriptions. The result will be greater functionality and interoperability for scholarship, pedagogy, and digital collection curation in the humanities with a freely accessible tool prepared for its second decade of existence.</p>
