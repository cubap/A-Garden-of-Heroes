## Description

<p>Development
of a location-based notification system that will be tested through the creation
of three new heritage tours in Kansas City, and then deployed for the 1400+ local
history trails within the Clio website. </p>
<p>Working with a diverse team of scholars, software developers, and organizations, our team will develop and test a new interpretive platform in Clio that will connect the public to humanities scholarship as they explore thematic three Kansas City history trails centered on jazz, baseball, and barbecue. The centerpiece of this prototyping project is the creation of a two-way geofencing system that will offer location-based media on the user's mobile device as they move along the trail while also sending a Bluetooth signal that triggers events within the userâ€™s physical surroundings. Our team will add more accessibility features and user options during the grant period that will enhance the 1400 existing trails and walking tours in Clio.</p>
