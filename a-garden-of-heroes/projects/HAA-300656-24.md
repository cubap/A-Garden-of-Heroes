## Description

<p>Design and launch of a digital project on the histories of global fashion using collections from multiple cultural heritage museums and the release of open-source software designed for smaller organizations to use for building their own global history projects. <br /></p>
<p>Connecting Threads: Digitally Connecting Collections, Expanding Public Engagement is an open access DH project that increases access to and engagement with global fashion histories by digitally connecting relevant collections from small museums and archives with larger collections through a queryable database. The database will be used to reorient the history of global fashion towards stories that connect makers and consumers of color, specifically, South Indian cotton textile weavers and Black and Brown consumers in the Caribbean and southeastern US. Key activities include processing collected data, building digital infrastructure including front-end, beta and user testing the site. Expected outputs are: a PostgreSQL database built on a custom API web crawler and with manual data entry options; a front-end platform capable of operating as a public-facing multi-institutional catalog; and interactive visualizations combining primary sources with research generated using the database.</p>
