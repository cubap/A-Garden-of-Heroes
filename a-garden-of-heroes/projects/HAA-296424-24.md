## Description

<p>Experimental development of digital preservation techniques, using the Flickr Commons photo-sharing platform as a case study, to create replicable models for social media archiving that would save digital networked assets for future humanities research.</p>
<p>The project is to research, design, and build prototype Data Lifeboat software for the Flickr photo-sharing service. Our goals are to create several rough prototypes of the software, develop a reasonably detailed understanding of the main technical challenges, prepare a survey of critical ongoing legal issues, and establish a robust design direction for further product development. This prototyping in public will contribute to the advancement of archival practice by demonstrating what the tools for archiving the essential parts of large, digitally networked cultural resources could be like and how they could work.</p>
