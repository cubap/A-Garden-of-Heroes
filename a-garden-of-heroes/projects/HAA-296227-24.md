## Description

<p>An exploratory effort to apply computer vision to a collection of 30,000 digitized epigraphic squeezes (paper negatives of inscriptions) to develop a new method for optical character recognition of Greek inscriptions.</p>
<p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has long been applied with increasing levels of accuracy to printed texts. More recently, spurred by advances in neural networks and increases in processing capability, OCR has also been applied successfully to manuscript texts, allowing for readable and searchable editions to be created for huge corpora of texts. This project will use the Institute for Advanced Study’s Krateros database, a digital collection featuring thousands of images of epigraphic squeezes—paper negatives of inscriptions—to develop OCR for Greek inscriptions. The project’s aims are to accelerate the publication of new analyses of historic Greek texts, draw critical attention to problem spots in existing transcriptions, and identify individual stonecutters’ handwriting. This innovative approach to humanities research will lay the groundwork for breakthrough discoveries that can transform our understanding of ancient history.</p>
