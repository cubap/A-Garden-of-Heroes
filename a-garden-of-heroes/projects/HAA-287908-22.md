## Description

<p>The development of 3D virtual reality methods to help elicit memory recall from current and former residents of a community in Florida to study how this technique can aid in collecting and documenting oral histories.</p>
<p>The MemoryScan: Humanizing Digital Twin Environments project (MemoryScan) seeks to develop a prototype community-scale Digital Twin platform to elicit memory recall from current and former citizens and visitors of a particular community. MemoryScan will examine the potential advantages of using Digital Twins (a complete virtual representation of a building(s)) as a tool to assist the capturing of participant reflections and supporting documentation. As an interactive 3D virtual environment, it is designed to be applied to large areas, which can enable users to move between structures without interrupting the experience evoking their reflections. This Digital Twin will permit, through a shared interview/exploration the collection of personal images and documents. Our research seeks to gather personal reflections and contextualize them with a broad spectrum of information related to a community.</p>
