## Description

<p>The development and testing of AI-based software
that uses named entity recognition and large language models to automatically create
subject tags for digitized cultural heritage materials to enhance search and
usability.  </p>
<p>SubjectSpotter will automate the creation of subject tags in the metadata and transcriptions of cultural heritage materials. The software will be tested using the Civil War and Reconstruction Governors of Mississippi, a digital documentary edition of nineteenth century governorsâ€™ records using LLM APIs to identify subjects and match them to controlled vocabularies, and then present those identified subjects to human editors for review. By the conclusion of the project, we will produce an open source, tested workflow and reusable software library that any developer can replicate, and also integrate it into the scholarly editing tool FromThePage.</p>
