## Description

<p>The expansion of an existing digital infrastructure for Indo-European languages to include creation of a set of linked online etymological dictionaries for early Mayan languages. </p>
<p>We request Level II DHAG funding, to expand our existing digital infrastructure for Indo-European languages, IELEX, and create MAYALEX: interlinked, extensible online etymological dictionaries for early Mayan languages. Words and their origins express the ideas, expressions, histories, and intertwining of cultures through time. Few digital resources meet the lexical needs of scholars of early Mesoamerica; still fewer invite non-specialists to explore. We will create a functional, publicly available prototype of user-friendly dictionaries that link words through their shared etymologies, starting with the Colonial Mayan language Ch’olti’. Users will be able to study words in a language of interest, explore the web of connections linking that language to others, browse words across or within languages according to form or meaning, and export their discoveries in several possible formats for further study.</p>
