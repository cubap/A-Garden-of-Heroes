## Description

<p>The continued development of computational methods to analyze and process handwritten scripts from 17th century documents.</p>
<p>We seek NEH funding to complete the development of a software that will enable twenty-first century scholars to expeditiously read and analyze seventeenth-century Spanish American notary records and efficiently find relevant content in these documentary collections. Using recent advances in deep learning and knowledge management, we will develop a tool to manage and analyze about 220,000 pages of digital images of seventeenth-century manuscripts available at the Archivo General de la Rep√∫blica Argentina located in Buenos Aires. This collection combines a large variety of handwritten scripts. Based on this distinctive collection, our proposed tool will enable processing manuscripts available at other archival sites and create research and collaboration opportunities elsewhere in Latin America.</p>
