## Description

<p>The continued development of the Digital
Humanities Resource Infrastructure for Teaching Technology (DHRIFT) platform to
provide technical training in digital humanities methodologies with a
particular focus on faculty and staff for historically under-resourced
institutions. </p>
<p>Access to technical training in the digital humanities is inequitably distributed, especially among historically underserved institutions. Since 2018, and with funding provided by two NEH-funded IATDH grants, the Graduate Center, CUNY has supported development of over 30 local DH institutes and intensives by training 48 DH practitioners as part of the Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI). Building on the demonstrated success of these approaches, GCDI proposes a social and infrastructural intervention, Digital Humanities Resource Infrastructure for Teaching Technology (DHRIFT), to provide pedagogical support to a wider DH community. DHRIFT is conceived around flexible infrastructure for deployable sites—DHRIFT Core—that can be readily set up at local institutions and which provide ready-to-teach OERs and additional functionality to support DH pedagogy. By building community, curriculum, and infrastructure, DHRIFT aims to facilitate the more equitable development of DH skills.</p>
