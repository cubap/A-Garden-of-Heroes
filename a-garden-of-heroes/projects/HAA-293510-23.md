## Description

<p>The development of open-source machine learning methods for quickly processing historical migrant records. </p>
<p>Migrants and the State will facilitate and expand access to a set of historical migrant records held by the U.S. National Archives (NARA) gathered in what are known as A-files. A-files contain a wide variety of documentation specific to the experiences of individual migrants and the implementation of U.S. immigration law. While in the public domain, these A-files are currently accessible only on a file-by-file basis. This project will use 550 A-files to develop machine learning models for segmenting the contents of A-files, identifying document types (e.g. government forms, correspondence, employment records, etc.), and adding detailed metadata about them, making it possible to examine them at scale and discern currently untraceable stories and patterns across a large number of A-files. The project will also create a minimal web interface to enable focus group testing with immigration historians to gather feedback and plan for the project's next phase.</p>
