## Description

<p>The addition of new features and documentation and the expansion of the translation interface for the Digital Archive of Indigenous Language Persistence platform.   </p>
<p>The Digital Archive of Indigenous Language Persistence (DAILP) seeks Level III funding to transform the DAILP translation interface (DAILP TI) prototype into a shareable resource for indigenous document translation. The prototype already draws on DAILP lexical datasets and resources to produce digital edited collections of translated and annotated indigenous language documents. We now move to a finalized, sustainable application that can be installed and used by partner projects, and we establish a community of support for the code in the long term. We will implement enhancements based on feedback from Cherokee community members, develop training materials and documentation, conduct a code sustainability and data management review, and test the DAILP TI with two test-case teams. By the end of the grant, we will be ready to disseminate the DAILP TI code to a wider community of projects, and empower those projects to support and contribute to the development of DAILP.</p>
