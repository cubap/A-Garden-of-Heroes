## Description

<p>The development and testing of a prototype database of early Indo-European languages, in partnership with the Linguistics Research Center at the University of Texas.</p>
<p>We are applying for a Level I grant to fund our project "DERBi PIE: a Database of Etymological Roots Beginning in Proto-Indo-European", to build, test, and evaluate an alpha-level prototype database of Indo-European (IE) languages that is engineered from its foundation to be easily extensible and shareable, with open-source code for advanced search tools and an emphasis on database design that not only allows but encourages data-sharing, re-use and re-implementation across different platforms. We will work in collaboration with the Linguistics Research Center (LRC) at the University of Texas at Austin to maximize compatibility of the database so that it can be readily implemented in the already existing Indo-European Lexicon (IELEX) website. We intend for DERBi PIE to provide the unified resources that all IE languages rely on for histories and etymologies, for both specialists and non-specialists alike, increasing access and visibility to the field.</p>
