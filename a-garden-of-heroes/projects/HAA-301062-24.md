## Description

<p>Development and release of an open-access research database and visualization tool for musicologists and media scholars to analyze global music streamed on internet radio. <br /></p>
<p>The purpose of the Music Informatics for Radio Across the GlobE (MIRAGE) project is to develop and release an open-access online dashboard that allows users to access, interact with, and export meta data and musicological features from the music found on internet radio, a relatively recent, and thus, underexamined medium that has become a multi-billion dollar industry over the last decade. To that end, the MIRAGE dashboard features MIRAGE-MetaCorpus, a data set consisting of meta data (e.g., artist name, song title, etc.) for millions of songs currently streaming on stations across the globe. In doing so, the MIRAGE project will enable scholars from across the humanities to explore the contemporary global listening landscape for a medium that places diversity center stage.</p>
