## Description

<p>Research
and testing of the Manifest platform designed to support humanities research of
supply chains and commodities. </p>
<p>While of significant social and environmental importance, global supply chains are both complex and opaque. Understanding the impact of these networks is challenging. Manifest is a digital humanities project designed to allow researchers in the humanities to produce critical accounts of global logistical operation and to communicate the impact of supply chains on society. This proposal will form a research network around Manifest's open-source, web-based platform for the critical analysis of supply chains, production lines, and trade networks. Based on case studies implemented on the Manifest platform by members of the research network, the project will construct a comprehensive research guide and curriculum for the critical study of logistics in the humanities.</p>
