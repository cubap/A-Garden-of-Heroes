## Description

<p>Further work on a platform that enables users to
transcribe, archive, and study non-Western music.</p>
<p>This proposal is to support the continued development of an “interactive digital transcription platform” (IDTP). The IDTP is a web-based application that allows for the digital transcription, archiving, sharing, and analysis of audio recordings of oral melodic and improvisational traditions, with a first focus on Hindustani music.</p>
