## Description

<p>Development and testing of new features for the Booksnake mobile app that projects digitized primary sources into interactive 3D spaces to enhance humanities teaching and learning. <br /></p>
<p>Booksnake makes it feel like digitized archival items are physically present in the real world by using augmented reality (AR) technology in consumer smartphones and tablets. While many projects use AR or virtual reality (VR) to publish custom content, Booksnake is a general-purpose, content-agnostic tool for existing digitized collections. Level II funding will enable users to juxtapose and compare multiple digitized items from four different archives (Library of Congress, David Rumsey Map Collection, Huntington Digital Library, and USC Digital Library) in physical space, and will support testing and dissemination. These activities respond to community feedback and build on four years of work. Expected outcomes include public release of a working application, open-source code, and technical documentation. This proposal advances NEH priorities of developing scalable digital tools to support the humanities, refining innovative computational methods, and evaluating their impacts.</p>
