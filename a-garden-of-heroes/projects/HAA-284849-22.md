## Description

<p>Scaling up development and dissemination of the iSpraak application as a free and open source language pronunciation instruction and learning tool. </p>
<p>This NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant proposal outlines the plan to enhance, scale, and provide free access to the web application iSpraak.

Originally developed for internal use at Saint Louis University in 2014, iSpraak has now been used by tens of thousands of students and instructors across the globe.
