## Description

<p>The enhancement of the cyberSW archaeology platform by including Indigenous cultural and language content relating to plant and animal Cultural Keystone Species and a redesign of the platform to make it more user-friendly, including on mobile devices.</p>
<p>cyberSW is currently an open access, web-based gateway for researchers interested in the archaeology of the Southwest United States and Northwestern Mexico. The proposed project will transform this gateway in two ways: first, to meet the interests and needs of the Indigenous communities whose ancestors lived in the places represented in cyberSW; and second, to encourage engagement by wider-ranging audiences of lifelong learners. Accordingly, achieving this goal involves two interrelated steps: first, expanding our digital Indigenous Field Guide to include Indigenous cultural and language content relating to plant and animalCultural Keystone Species (CKS) as identified by our Tribal partners; and second, redesigning the cyberSW web platform to make it easier to use and explore, including on mobile devices while out on the landscape.</p>
