## Description

<p>The development of software enhancements, accompanied by additional outreach activities, for the humdrum(R) software platform for computational music analysis.</p>
<p>Musicology research is a humanistic endeavor well suited to computational methods. Yet, despite the work of a small niche of scholars, most humanistic music scholarship is conducted via traditional, non-digital techniques. Building on a level II NEH-DHAG grant, we seek additional NEH funding to continue to develop software tools, datasets, and pedagogical materials for computational musicology analysis that would appeal to musicologists, music theorists, and ethnomusicologists alike.  This project will create new data to facilitate the study of non-Western music, and expand the existing humdrumR tools to include new standardized representation schemes and incorporate a greater variety of musical media (such as audio and video). The humdrumR project is based off a well-established computational musicology framework, humdrum, but modernized and expanded to facilitate a complete digital musicology workflow including reading and analyzing data, graphing, and statistical analysis.</p>
