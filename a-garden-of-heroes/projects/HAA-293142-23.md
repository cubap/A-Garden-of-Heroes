## Description

<p>The creation of a digital research platform and tools for accessing and studying photographic archives spanning a total of fourteen collections.</p>
<p>PHAROS: The International Association of Photo Archives, a collaboration between fourteen North American and European art historical photo archives, aims to create an open and freely accessible digital research platform allowing for comprehensive and consolidated access to photo archive images and associated scholarly documentation. Following a three-year Mellon grant to build a pilot, support from the NEH will enable the platform to move into production and make the project sustainable. The planned work will result in a robust, scalable, and seamless research platform for art historians, digital humanists, data scientists, and the general public. The semantically enriched and structured data can contribute to a vibrant culture of open scholarship and collaboration among researchers from multiple disciplines, disrupting barriers that have been posed by the difficulties of navigating proprietary art historical databases in which information is siloed.</p>
