## Description

<p>The continued development of the Mapping Color in History
(MCH) portal that allows scholars to analyze and compare pigment data from
historical paintings.</p>
<p>Mapping Color in History [MCH] brings together the scientific data drawn from existing and on-going material analyses of pigments in Asian painting in a historical perspective.  As a digital portal with a searchable online database, MCH does not only document pigments and their material properties, but also enable an in-depth historical analysis of pigment data through a search tool that identifies specific examples and their locations in both time and space. By developing a database ontology that can bring together fragmentary and uneven data with complex lateral and hierarchical relationships and by compiling pigment analysis data and deep historical research in a systematic manner, MCH enables truly interdisciplinary research and collaboration, connecting humanists and scientists.</p>
