## Description

<p>The development of web-based tools and documentation to allow both novice and expert users to interact with data from the HathiTrust Digital Library.</p>
<p>The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) seeks $325,000 in funding for a period of 2 years, through the Digital Humanities Advancement Grants program, Level III, for the development of next-generation web-based, interactive visualization and analytical tool dashboard that consume existing data from our one-of-a-kind, fully open Extracted Features dataset, along with a well-documented API to allow our user community to develop its own tools for interacting with data from the 17.5-million-volume HathiTrust Digital Library. We will develop and promote these tools and API through a robust community outreach program that includes a public event and hack-a-thon focused on tool building.</p>
