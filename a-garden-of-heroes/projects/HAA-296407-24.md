## Description

<p>A partnership between the National Yiddish Book Center and the Language Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania to refine a method to improve error correction in optical character recognition for Yiddish.  </p>
<p>This proposal will support the development of an experimental system to improve error correction on the existing Yiddish Book Center optical character recognition (OCR) projects, which are the first and largest instances of OCR for Yiddish done at scale. The experimental systems will correct a 650 million word corpus (about 12,000 scanned Yiddish books) of Yiddish text produced by optical character recognition (OCR) which is available now at the Yiddish Book Centerâ€™s full-text search website (http://ocr.yiddishbookcenter.org). This corpus will double in size by 2025 upon the completion of a separate OCR project, the Universal Yiddish Library. The Universal Yiddish Library Project will add at least 10,000 additional books from multiple institutions to the existing corpus, and the OCR correction methods used for this project will be applied to the Universal Yiddish Library corpus in the future.</p>
