## Description

<p>A series of workshops in Arizona, New Mexico, and California and the development of a digital curriculum on the creation of culturally-appropriate descriptive metadata and narration for Native American films based on the Tribesourcing Southwest Film website.</p>
<p>Tribesourcing Southwest Film digitally repurposes a collection of midcentury educational and sponsored films about Native peoples of the Southwestern U.S., reclaiming visual content through recording culturally-informed alternate audio tracks voiced by Native narrators from within the cultures represented. This process, which we have termed “tribesourcing,” has the double benefit of repatriating historic images and decolonizing these archival films, visible at Tribesourcingfilm.com. In this proposal, we seek to extend the project by: recording additional narrations in Southern California, Arizona and New Mexico; developing a digital curriculum for workshops; and to begin decentralizing the project through a series of workshops to help communities who wish to do their own tribesourcing with their own archived audio-visual materials.</p>
