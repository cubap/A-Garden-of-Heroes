## Description

<p>The creation of a resource to transcribe early polyphonic
music into standard notation and develop a corpus to allow scholars and
students to search, compare, and analyze early music.</p>
<p>During the grant period we would: 1. create a free, open-access website on which to store what will eventually be approximately 110 organa, 460 clausulae, and 680 motets along with their rhythmic and melodic variants; 2. transcribe approximately a quarter of this music into modern notation (25 organa, 100 clausulae, 150 motets) presenting multiple plausible transcriptions of each work each of which will then be entered into the website as .xml files and then analyzed using MEI; 3. create an interface using Edirom and GET requests which will allow users to compare as many versions of a given work as desired, and allow them to create and print a hybrid edition which could combine several of the versions together according to the user''s specifications.</p>
