## Description

<p>The creation of new user experience and accessibility features for the Windows to the World educational platform and workshops for K-12 educators. </p>
<p>Funding will support the project across two primary pillars of development: Platform Enhancement and Technical Development with a focus on improving user experience  and adding new features to the existing framework, and User Base Evaluation and Expansion, to support a growing cohort of Indiana teachers of all grade levels whose experience with the  platform can inform future improvements to the projectâ€™s function and form. By the end of the 24-month period of performance, we anticipate the project will have grown to reach hundreds of  new educators and thousands of students thereby connecting them with the digital humanities in an engaging, accessible, and fun manner.</p>
