## Description

<p>An empirical study investigating alternative map icons, a conference on map symbolization and innovative mapping tools, and creation of a research agenda that re-envisions conventional map icon libraries. </p>
<p>Map icons are tiny pixel-based symbols that locate people, places, and events commonly prepackaged into icon libraries and used in mapping in the digital humanities (DH). Given their size and ubiquity, map icons are often overlooked and applied universally in maps despite reflecting cultural contexts and power relations. I am applying for a Level I DHAG to reconceptualize map icons as sites and their libraries as tools for feminist resistance. I will convene scholars, practitioners, and communities invested in transformative approaches to mapping. The five outcomes of this feminist mapping intervention include: an empirical study investigating alternative map icons and DH mapping tools, a subsequent journal article, a two-day hybrid conference on map symbolization and innovative mapping tools, a special issue curated from conference presentations, and a research agenda that re-envisions conventional map icon libraries using crowdsourcing methods and open-source technologies like QGIS.</p>
