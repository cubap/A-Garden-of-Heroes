## Description

<p>The continued development of the Allmaps georeferencing platform to allow institutions with cartographic collections to better share their resources and for scholars, students, and the general public to more successfully engage with these collections.</p>
<p>In partnership with the American Geographical Society Library, the Leventhal Map & Education Center will build an open-source platform for georeferencing digitized cartographic collections, based on the Allmaps software library already under development. By building a patron-facing digital interface for georeferencing—a term which refers to the use of software to align scanned maps with real-world geographies—hundreds of cultural institutions around the world can make their digitized map collections newly vibrant for scholars, educators, and the public.</p>
