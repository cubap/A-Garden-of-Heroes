## Description


<p>This project creates digital infrastructure to increase access to archival dance information. Leveraging the digital framework of an archive built with previous NEH support for the collection, No Boundaries: Dancing the Visions of Contemporary Black Choreographers, the research team will prototype a dance data commons based on the Wikidata integration model and create tools that enable data exchange between this commons and individual archives. Four existing digital performing arts archives, Jacob’s Pillow Archives, Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Hamm Archives, Liz Lerman Archives, and ChromaDiverse, have agreed to partner by allowing access to their data to test integration across multiple systems. This project also involves a partnership with the University of Texas at Austin, where Co-PI Gesel Mason serves as associate professor, and subcontractor/software developer Whirl-i-Gig.</p>
