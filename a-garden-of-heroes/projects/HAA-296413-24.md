## Description

<p>Further development of an existing digital toolkit, mapKurator, to enhance the ability to automatically identify, recover, and transcribe text from maps.</p>
<p>The University of Southern California Digital Library, the University of Minnesota’s Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Knowledge Computing Lab, and the University of Sheffield’s Digital Humanities Institute respectfully request support under the Tier II category to further develop the mapKurator pipeline to enhance its capabilities for identifying, transcribing, and recognizing semantic contexts for text on historical maps. Our team will train, test, and evaluate the pipeline to distinguish between the text representing geographic features on the map, or text “inside the neat line,” and other text on the map that includes information about the map and how to use it (metadata), details about the regions represented, cultural information, and anything else mapmakers add to contextualize maps.</p>
