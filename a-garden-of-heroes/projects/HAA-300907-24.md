## Description

<p>The creation of a virtual model and garden of a Pompeian house using excavation, LiDAR scanning, and integrated 3D-GIS to investigate the ways that people of different genders, ages, and physical conditions experienced domestic space. </p>
<p>I am applying for Level II funding for a 3D virtual modeling project based on data from an archaeological excavation that I co-direct at Pompeii: the Casa della Regina Carolina (CRC) Project at Pompeii. From 2018–2023, a joint Cornell University/University of Bologna team has documented a large but mostly unpublished Pompeian house and excavated its garden area to construct a richer, more multidisciplinary, and more inclusive account of the ways that built space shaped Roman domestic life. Using excavation, LiDAR scanning, and integrated 3D-GIS, we now seek to complete a virtual model of the house and garden as they existed in 79 CE in order to investigate the ways that people of different genders, ages, and physical conditions would have experienced domestic space.</p>
