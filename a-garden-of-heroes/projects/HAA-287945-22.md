## Description

<p>The development of new features and expansion of the user base for the free and open-source HistoryForge, a digital public humanities project that brings census records together with historical maps into one interface that fosters research and teaching of local histories.</p>
<p>HistoryForge is a digital application that combines historic maps with census records of the people who live in a community. The initial prototype visualizes the demographic data on searchable maps that allows users and institutions to more fully connect with primary source historical records. The proposed project expands the functionality of the HistoryForge prototype, and supports the further adoption by additional testing partners.</p>
