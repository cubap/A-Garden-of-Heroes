## Description

<p>The development and testing with humanities scholars of an open source mobile recording app for collecting “audio diaries” for use in research and public engagement. </p>
<p>This project builds on the success of an existing prototype for a remote recording mobile app used to collect "audio diaries" in 2020-2021. We aim to redevelop the code for the front end of the app and refactor the code for the back end, resulting in a shareable app infrastructure that may be adopted by researchers at any number of institutions. We will bring together a user community of beta testing researchers across the humanities who may benefit from a remote recording app, which we hope to expand during the second year of funding into a broad user community and support system. The code and user manual will be published on a public GitLab repository, enabling future improvements by the user community.</p>
