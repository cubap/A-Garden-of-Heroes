## Description

<p>The creation of software to easily allow non-programmers to develop interactive public humanities digital projects.</p>
<p>The Photogrammar Visualization Software (PGVis) is an open-source tool for the visualization and exploration of image collections. PGVis will allow anyone with a collection of digital images and associated metadata to create, with no prior programming experience, their own digital public humanities projects in the form of public websites. In addition to the software, the project will produce six case studies that will model and highlight how the software can be used in a variety of different domains, data sizes, and types of institutions.</p>
