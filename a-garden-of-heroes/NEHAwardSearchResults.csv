Viewers particularly noted the veracity of Constable’s clouds. Indeed, our computational research shows that Constable’s clouds are more closely modeled on the structure of actual clouds than those of his contemporaries, with French academician Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes a near rival. Valenciennes taught a generation of landscape artists, emphasizing the importance of plein-air sky studies, yet histories of French landscape tend to cast Constable as Realism’s catalyst.

We will collate manual transcripts from the Text Creation Partnership with optical character recognition output from the microfilms of the Short Title Catalogue of Early English Printed Books recently scanned by the Internet Archive and other open-access images. This dataset will support more accurate OCR, text normalization, restoring textual gaps with evidence from comparable copies and editions, detecting manuscript annotations, and contextual embeddings of words and pages to support search and bibliographic analysis. We will publish this data for over 242,000 early modern printed books and all code under an open-source license. This project complements our team's work on OCR, book search, and corpora beyond the English STC.</p>"

Yet, despite the work of a small niche of scholars, most humanistic music scholarship is conducted via traditional, non-digital techniques. Building on a level II NEH-DHAG grant, we seek additional NEH funding to continue to develop software tools, datasets, and pedagogical materials for computational musicology analysis that would appeal to musicologists, music theorists, and ethnomusicologists alike.  This project will create new data to facilitate the study of non-Western music, and expand the existing humdrumR tools to include new standardized representation schemes and incorporate a greater variety of musical media (such as audio and video). The humdrumR project is based off a well-established computational musicology framework, humdrum, but modernized and expanded to facilitate a complete digital musicology workflow including reading and analyzing data, graphing, and statistical analysis.</p>"

With this award, our team of dramaturgs, developers, Shakespeare scholars, and pedagogy experts will use feedback from educators and theatre professionals to further develop the tool, its documentation, and related educational material over the course of a year, resulting in two major outputs: 1) the release of a minimum viable product version of the platform; and 2) a decision as to whether to commit to the ongoing work necessary to promote and maintain such a project on a national scale.</p>"

While many projects use AR or virtual reality (VR) to publish custom content, Booksnake is a general-purpose, content-agnostic tool for existing digitized collections. Level II funding will enable users to juxtapose and compare multiple digitized items from four different archives (Library of Congress, David Rumsey Map Collection, Huntington Digital Library, and USC Digital Library) in physical space, and will support testing and dissemination. These activities respond to community feedback and build on four years of work. Expected outcomes include public release of a working application, open-source code, and technical documentation. This proposal advances NEH priorities of developing scalable digital tools to support the humanities, refining innovative computational methods, and evaluating their impacts.</p>"
